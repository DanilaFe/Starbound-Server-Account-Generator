Starbound-Server-Account-Generator
==================================

#### Easily generate accounts, banned users, ips and playernames!
  Starbound servers lack the ability to easily add user accounts to the configuration file - you have to modify the files manually,
and I personally always messed up. So I made this tool - with simplicity in mind. It quickly reads your current Starbound account file, and then provides a GUI to easily edit it. When you're done, just click save (And restart your server)!
#### Downloading and Installing
 If you want a precompiled version, simply head to the Versions subfolded and get the latest file from there. Unzip, run. If you for some reason want to compile it yourself, feel free to clone and add it to your IDE!
#### Contributing
  I'm not that good at coding, so if anybody wants to help improve this tool they're free to!
